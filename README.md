<img src="https://www.evernote.com/l/AB_7AOh5bd5A5JqiDbz-7bAU1rx3XsF3YJQB/image.png" />

Sterntiles is a java program written by Parker Haynes, Vinita Popat, and Patrick Roberts, students in an AP Computer Science class, taught by Harlan Howe.

You can use sterntiles to design orthographic tileset .png files to use with other TileMap programs, like Tiled. The program consists of a pixel-by-pixel editor on the left, a collection of tiles (the output of the program) in the lower right, a toolbar in the middle, and a "sandbox" where you can arrange tiles to see how they will fit together.

Sterntiles is freeware. If you have questions or comments, contact harlan d•t howe at kinkaid d•t org.
